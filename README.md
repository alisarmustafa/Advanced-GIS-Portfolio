# About me
My name is Alisar and I was born and raised in Syria before escaping to Austria at the age of 14 then moving to Berkeley, California a year and a half later. The Syrian Refugee Crisis ignited my passion towards education reform because I saw it as the only way we as a society can have sustainable, long lasting social change that would serve as a preventative measure rather than damage control. 

I grew up under a totalitarian government where we were constantly surveilled through phone tapping, internet tracking and simply words of mouth which cost my father 14 years in Syrian jail (which if you know anything about that.. it's horrible to say the least) simply for expressing his opinion to oppose the government. My experiences in my ealry childhood strongly affected my passion towards digital privacy and its association to freedom of speech and when I read George Orwell's Book 1984 in my Sophomore English Class in Berkeley, I was 100% sold on advocating for digital privacy. 

Less depressing stuff about me haha: I like to read and write comic books. I know how to juggle, I watch too many youtube videos on AI/ML Ethics and Digital Privacy, my favorite video game is called Gris and I also like Stardew Valley. My favorite movie is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I also hate writing about myself so hopefully this intro was fine. 

# What I hope to learn:
1. How to make GIS more accessible to read, map design, colors, other things that makes a map unique but also simple to read. 
2. How to embed maps to websites other than github and ARC GIS Storymap
3. How to minimze bias in the map design and implementation
4. How to check for bias in datasets that we want to use
